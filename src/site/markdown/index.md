## Overview

The Avionos AEM Foundation contains common utilities, decorators, and abstract classes for bootstrapping and simplifying AEM projects.

## Goals

* Accelerate project development by defining a simple process for implementing the underlying component logic.
* Ensure a consistent structure and implementation pattern for all component classes.
* Isolate AEM-specific concerns (accessing the JCR, adapting Sling and AEM objects, building links) into common modules.
* Achieve a high level of code reuse both within and across AEM projects.
